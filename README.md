According to portland business journal, the sneaker industry could be worth up to 6 billion by the year 2025. As consumers already spend up to 2 billion for sneakers in the secondary market. 

Investors are also trying to capitalize on this booming industry by investing in limited and high in demand sneakers hoping that prices would appreciate.  One example is a famous Canadian investor Miles nadel who spent who spent over 1.2 million on over 10 pairs of sneakers at a public auction. 

Why are investors investing in sneakers. Because some sneakers tend to appreciate. If you can find the right product it can be a safer investment than stocks. A few factors that determine prices include inflation, number in circulation. Here is an example of an air jordan 1 Gina which is said to be limited to less than 5000 in circulation. Once people overseas got word of how limited it is a low demand sneaker instantly started spiking in prices. 

Which is why I decided to build machine learning models to help people that are trying to purchase sneaker insights on how much they can expect a sneaker can appreciate throughout time. However, there are many factors to prices such as restocks that can still greatly affect the market. The model I built is using a linear regression model and does not that those factors into account.
